### Installing & Running WebPack 
Problem: we have many modules it's mean we have many http requests.
To solve it we could use WebPack to generate single file.
1. Run command `npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server typescript ts-loader`
2. Create `webpack.config.js` file and configure it 
3. Remove all from dist folder
4. Add script to package file like `"build": "webpack"` 
5. Run command `npm run build`
